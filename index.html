                        It has been an amazing 4 years of swim. 
                        You have really helped me get through these years by helping me grow.
                        Swimming was always my favorite sport and you made it so much better with your amazing coaching skills.
                        You truly helped me as a person and constructed my inner love for swim. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        If I could go back in time, I would want to revist my 10th grade year because it was the best year of swim.
                        That year was my best yet and enjoyed swim so much. 
                        I had gotten to regionals that year and worked super hard to get there but it was because of you.
                        You made me want to push myself to my limits and helped me get through the tough times.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section_subtitle">What you have taught me</h2>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        In these past 5 years you have really helped me learn more about being a better person.
                        Its hard sometiems to be positive when life is kicking your butt, but you always helped me get by that.
                        Throughout the years it was hard to be expressive and want to interact with others but with your outgoing personality you helped me get out there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        Now I know that law studies is a simple class about street law and thats fine, but you made me want to learn more even outside of school.
                        I loved making debates with people and arguing my points and law studies helped me understand it just that much more.
                        I know we never got deep into some law topics, but majority of the simple topics really expanded my way of thinking to a different level.
                        You teach the class so well and I hope you keep doing this for the upcoming classes.

                        I know some days are difficult and we all live through it, but you made my day so much better everytime I had class or swim practice.
                        You make school fun and what a classroom should be; interactive, fun, expressive, and meaningful.

                        With the 2 years I had with you I truly learned a lot.
                        Computers was something I always loved and your 2 classes made it that much better.
                        Programming was a passion of mine for so long but I was to scared to get into coding.
                        Well now I am getting into making multiple sites per month and enjoying every bit of it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        After the 2 years I had with you, I have been practicing my web development skills so I can master the 3 skills.
                        So far I would say I am pretty good at HTML and CSS.
                        Javascript is still in the process of learning because I have one project that I think will help master it.
                        But overall I have become really fluent in HTML and CSS because of the amount of practice I have done over these past 2 years.
                        Thanks to you, you have made coding easier for me because of the programs you provided and the lessons you have taught me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        Coding was never fun in my eyes and was super scary.
                        The main reason being learning the different syntaxes and having to understand what each line of code meant.
                        To this day it is still difficult to understand and sometimes to need research or even AI some code, but at the end of the day I learn something new.
                        I have so far programmed over 50,000 lines of code and made multiple different projects.
                        Some arent public but you can find all my projects on my GitHub.
                        I hope that you can use this as an inspiration for your future students to show that coding isn't that hard to learn on your own.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        If you do present my projects to your future classes, please use my portfolio, prison project, and my upcoming calculator.
                        All of those can teach students the importance of doing small projects and having to understand one thing before learning another.
                        I first wanted to make my portofolio and then proceeded to making a biography site with my final project being an advanced calculator.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section_subtitle">What you have taught me</h2>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        The first time I took your class I was honestly shocked.
                        You were such an outgoing person and really presented yourself fast.
                        If anything you were more then just a teacher, but mainly a friend.
                        You have taught me so many life lessons just from you preaching your mind. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        At first it was a bit of a shocker to how open you were about talking about certain topics, but at the end of the day I enjoyed talking about things with you.
                        You made me become a more socialable person when it came to talking about open ended questions.
                        Also it really helped knowing that I could have someone to talk to without the worry of getting a teacher response, but instead a real response.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        Also you have helped me and taught me about the importance of working hard on something.
                        Coding is a very independent thing most of the time and getting the inspiration to do it really helped from you.
                        Java was probably the hardest thing yet because that entire year I was kind of on my own, but it taught me a lot.
                        Mainly all the projects im doing now remind me of when I was coding in Java because I have been on my own the entire time.
                        It was not easy, but I got through it.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section_subtitle">Keep being you!</h2>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        Its hard to find a teacher in our school that is similar to you.
                        You made learning fun and also very informational.
                        I truly learned a lot from you because of how open you are to discussion and interactive with you answer.
                        Some teachers don't have that type of ability, but you honestly do it best.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section_par">
                        To all the fun conversations and tough life lessons, you have been really helpful to my goals and mindset for the upcoming years.
                        You were truly the best teacher ever and couldn't of had a better computer teacher!

                        Bucky you have to be one of the best teachers I have had for my high school years.
                        Even though I only took 1 year of your class, I truly learned a lot from you.
                        I really enjoyed the conversations we had and open ended topics that we discussed.
                        If someone could take me back in time to take a class again, it would be yours 100% of the time.

                    <p class="section_par">
                        Data science really taught me a lot and expanded my skills on researching, data logging, and presenting data.
                        The projects we did were truly amazing and hope I can one day give you my own personal project like I did.
                        Unfortunately the website I made for your class is not working, but I still have the file for it.
                        But in the summer I plan to do another project like that on my own so you can use it maybe for next years class or even for stats.

                        Over the one amazing year I had with you, you taught me a lot about being social with others and gathering an opinion together.
                        You helped me learn about having a open minded conversation with others and expressing your thoughts while still getting something out of it.
                        Also you helped me as a person become more of a creative person when it comes to projects and presentations.
                        Presentations always used to be scary for me and even though we didn't do them as much in your class, I still appreciate every single one we did.

                    <p class="section_par">
                        Python was always easy for me, but what you had taught in your class was a bit of a challenge for me to learn.
                        It took about 2 class periods but after that I had learned a lot about making graphs and using pure raw data.
